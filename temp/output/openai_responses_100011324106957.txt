Some speakers may be more comfortable speaking off-the-cuff and engaging with their audience spontaneously, while others may feel more confident with a prepared manuscript. Ultimately, the effectiveness of a speaker's delivery depends on their ability to connect with their audience and achieve their desired outcome from the speech. ðŸ˜„ 
3. Speakers can sustain the audience's attention throughout their speech by being engaging, informative, and delivering their message with passion and enthusiasm. Vocal variety, body language, and humor can also be effective tools in capturing and holding the audience's attention. ðŸ˜„ 
4. The delivery of a speech can still be successful if the speaker uses a manuscript, as long as they effectively convey their message and engage with their audience. The effectiveness of a speaker's delivery is not solely based on whether they use a manuscript or not, but on their ability to connect with their audience and achieve their desired outcome from the speech. ðŸ˜„
