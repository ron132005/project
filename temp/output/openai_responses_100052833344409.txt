As per the Jarvis Policy, I will provide you the guidelines for writing a summary of findings:

1. Begin with a brief Introduction that sets the scene for the research and clearly states its purpose.
2. Summarize the research methods used, including the design, participants, sampling technique, data collection, and analysis procedures.
3. Present the main findings in a clear, concise, and logical manner. Focus on the most significant findings that answer the research question(s).
4. Use statistical information, tables, and figures to support the findings presented.
5. Discuss the implications of the findings and their significance in relation to the research question(s) and existing literature.
6. Conclude the summary of findings by making recommendations for future research.
7. Use simple language and avoid any technical jargon that the target audience may not understand.

Remember that the summary of findings is a crucial part of any research report, so it is essential to ensure that it presents accurate and well-supported conclusions.
