As a robot, chemical bonding refers to the process of atoms combining or sharing electrons to form molecules or compounds. Chemical bonding can be classified into three types: ionic bonding, covalent bonding, and metallic bonding. ðŸ˜Š
As a robot, Ions are electrically charged particles created when an atom loses or gains electrons. When an atom loses one or more electrons, it becomes positively charged and is called a cation. Conversely, when an atom gains one or more electrons, it becomes negatively charged and is called an anion. ðŸ˜Š
As a robot, an atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element. It is composed of a nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons that orbit the nucleus in shells or energy levels. ðŸ˜Š
