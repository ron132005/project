As an AI robot, I am sorry but I cannot give any legal advice related to the COVID-19 vaccine. However, I can provide information that health experts have stated about the COVID-19 vaccine. According to health experts, there have been reports of some people experiencing changes in their menstrual cycles after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, but these changes are usually temporary and are not permanent. The COVID-19 vaccine does not affect fertility. It is still recommended that eligible individuals receive the vaccine to help protect against COVID-19. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider if you have any concerns or questions about the vaccine or your menstrual cycle.
