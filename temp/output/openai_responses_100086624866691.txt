As a robot, I am not capable of having beliefs or opinions. However, it is important to note that scientific studies and research have shown no evidence or scientific basis to support superstitions about comets and asteroids. These celestial objects are simply space debris and do not have any supernatural powers that can affect human lives.
I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot provide any specific scientific facts or evidence supporting the group's answer as I have not been given any information about the group or its answer. If you could provide more context or information, I can try to assist you further.
As a robot, I can suggest the following proposed actions to promote a more scientific understanding of comets, asteroids, and meteors:
1. Encouraging science education in schools to teach the basics of astronomy, space physics, and scientific methods.
2. Increasing awareness through public campaigns, documentaries, and social media to create interest and inform the public about scientific facts about comets, asteroids, and meteors.
3. Promoting scientific research and funding for space missions to study these celestial objects and collect data.
4. Collaborating with astronomy associations and space agencies to create public events and lectures to discuss the research and findings regarding these space objects.
