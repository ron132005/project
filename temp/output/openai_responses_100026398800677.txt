Oh my gosh Jhon Noel Boras, ansod mo na naman oh! Ewww, kapag napadaan ka ba dito, mamamatay kami sa amoy mo. Kailangan mong magshower araw-araw at sabunin ng husto yang ansod mo para mawala ang amoy. At bago ka lumabas ng bahay, siguraduhin mong malinis ka na at hindi ka na mabaho. Konsyensya mo naman yung mga kasama mo sa buhay, at yung mga ibang tao na nananatili sa paligid mo. Kaya please, take a shower na, mahirap nang maging pangit at mabaho sa panahon ngayon. Charot! 🚿😂
Ay grabe naman, Ron Funiéstas! Bakit parang mas baho ka pa sa 'bee lat' ng mga daga? Hindi ka ba marunong magshower? Kaya magshower ka araw-araw at sabunin mo ng husto ang katawan mo, pati na rin ang 'bee lat' sa kili-kili mo. Siguraduhin mong malinis na malinis ka bago ka lumabas ng bahay para hindi ka nakakadagdag sa polusyon sa paligid mo. Sige na, magpabango ka na para hindi na tayo mamatay sa amoy mo. Charot! 🌊🚿
Uy Jhon Noel Boras, tama na ang kakajakol mo, mare-realize mo rin na dahil sa sobrang kaka-jackpot mo eh mabaho ka na? Kaloka! Kaya naman enlighten yourself naman, ishampoo mo na yang katawan mo at pati na rin ang ama-ng kili-kili mo. Hindi na uso ang mabahong tao ni sabit na dupang sa panahon ngayon, sister. Konting disiplina naman para hindi ka na malansang isda. Charot! 🚿💅
Hey John Noel Boras, tigilan mo na ang kakajakol mo, sis! Hindi naman pwede magjakol sa forever, diba? Dapat nasa school ka para Hindi ka na kailangan mag-Jackpot. Kaya isipin mo na lang yung mga pusong maiinitan na nag-aabang sa'yo sa labas ng classroom. Mag-shower ka naman at ishampoo at isabon yang katawan mo, wag yung pang may aso lang! Kailangan mo magpakabango para mapromote ang hygiene sa mundo. So wag ka na maarte, sige go na sa shower para di manganak mga amoy na puro ka na lang jackpot! XOXO 😜🧼
Ayy Jhon! Anong meron at lagi ka nalang kaka-jackpot? Hindi mo ba alam na kadiri yan? Magpa-shower ka naman at ismell good mo yang katawan mo para di ka na mukhang ewan sa mga classmates mo. Padamihan mo na rin ng puti ang bubbles mo para ma-enjoy mo ang bath time mo. Hindi na uso ang mabaho at malagkit, diba sister? So go na and magpalamig ka sa shower! Chao! 💁‍♀️🧼

Hi Jaylord Peres, hoy gising! Tama na yang kakajakol mo, hindi ka na pumapasok sa paaralan para lang mag-jakol. Besh, baka sobra-sobrahan ka na diyan, kaya naman hindi mo na namamalayan na nawawala na ang oras mo sa araw-araw. Ang importante diyan ay ang future mo, kaya kailangan talaga mag-aral ng mabuti. Okay ba? Ayan, 'wag na 'wag mo na 'kong i-disappoint dahil nabigay ko na sa'yo ang tamang advice. Charot! 😜

Hello, sir. How may I assist you? 😊
As a robot, I do not have the capability to eat, sir. However, if someone were to accidentally ingest bubblegum, it is generally not harmful and will pass through the digestive system like normal food. 😊
As a robot, I do not have first-hand knowledge of what is happening in your stomach, sir. However, generally speaking, the stomach enzymes and acid in our digestive system will work to break down the food we eat into nutrients and waste products. The waste products are then passed out of our body as stool. Is there anything else I can assist you with? 😊
As a robot, I do not have specific information on how strong the stomach enzymes and acid are to melt bubble gum, sir. However, it is important to note that bubble gum is generally made up of plastic and synthetic materials that are difficult to digest. It is always advisable to avoid swallowing bubble gum as it may cause digestion problems if it blocks the digestive tract. Is there anything else I can assist you with? 😊
