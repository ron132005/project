Finally, we can solve for the rate per payment period using the formula Rate per Period = ((1 + Interest Rate per Period)^12) - 1. 
Plugging in the given values and the solved for present value, we have Interest Rate per Period = (1 + (166515.92/(3000 x 60)))^(1/12) - 1 â‰ˆ 0.42%
Therefore, the rate per payment period is approximately 0.42%. [ðŸ˜Š]
As a robot, I would be happy to help you with your question. 
Using the formula for future value of an annuity, we have: 
FV = PMT x (((1 + (r/n))^(n*t)) - 1) / (r/n)
where
PMT = â‚± 1000 (monthly deposit)
r = 0.03 (annual interest rate)
n = 4 (compounding periods per year)
t = 5 (number of years)
Plugging in these values, we get:
FV = â‚± 1000 x (((1 + (0.03/4))^(4*5)) - 1) / (0.03/4)
FV = â‚± 65,811.83
So after five years, Joanne's savings account will have approximately â‚± 65,811.83. [ðŸ˜Š]
Given the contributions of Fitch, Gary, Hanna, and Ina are â‚±20,000, â‚±100,000, â‚±30,000, and â‚±150,000 respectively, then Jasper's contribution is â‚±300,000 (since it is three times Gary's contribution). 
Therefore, the total value of the business is the sum of all the contributions, which is: 
â‚±20,000 + â‚±100,000 + â‚±30,000 + â‚±150,000 + â‚±300,000 = â‚±600,000 
So the total value of the business is â‚±600,000. [ðŸ˜„]
As a robot, to solve the problem, we need to know the total number of outstanding shares of the company. Since the company has 10,000 total outstanding shares and Tony owns 10 shares, we can calculate his ownership percentage by dividing the number of shares he owns by the total number of outstanding shares: 
10 shares / 10,000 shares = 0.001 or 0.1%
Tony owns 0.1% of the company's assets and earnings. [ðŸ˜„]
As a robot, based on the given information, Mr. Santos' loan is a type of loan with regular monthly payments and a fixed interest rate compounded annually. To calculate his loan, we can use the following formula:

Loan = (Payment per period x ((1 + interest rate per period)^(total number of periods) - 1)) / interest rate per period

In this case, the payment per period is â‚±3,000, the interest rate per period is 0.03/12 = 0.0025 (since the interest rate is compounded annually and we need to adjust it for monthly payments), and the total number of periods is 5 x 12 = 60 (since there are 5 years with 12 months each).

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Loan = (3,000 x ((1 + 0.0025)^60 - 1)) / 0.0025
Loan = â‚±173,401.41 [ðŸ˜„]

Therefore, Mr. Santos' loan is worth â‚±173,401.41.
